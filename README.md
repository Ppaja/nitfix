## How to Add Your Own Videos

To add a new video to Nitfix, follow these steps:

1. Choose a YouTube video you want to add.
2. Copy the video ID from the video's URL. For example, if the YouTube URL is "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po4iNQTbX7A," you would copy "Po4iNQTbX7A." 

3. Replace both "REPLACE" in this code:

   ```html
   <div class="video-container" data-video-id="REPLACE">
       <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/REPLACE/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video Thumbnail">
   </div>
   
4. done: you added a movie
